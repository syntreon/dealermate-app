## Overview

The Design Phase transforms approved requirements into a comprehensive technical design that serves as a blueprint for implementation. This phase involves research, architectural decisions, and detailed planning that bridges the gap between what needs to be built (requirements) and how it will be built (implementation tasks).

## Purpose and Goals

The design phase serves to:
- Translate requirements into technical architecture and system design
- Conduct necessary research to inform design decisions
- Define system components, interfaces, and data models
- Establish error handling and testing strategies
- Create a foundation for breaking down work into implementation tasks
- Document design rationale and decision-making process

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis and Research Planning

**Objective**: Understand requirements deeply and identify areas needing research

**Process**:
1. **Review Requirements Thoroughly**: Understand each requirement and its implications
2. **Identify Technical Unknowns**: List areas where research is needed
3. **Plan Research Activities**: Prioritize research based on design impact
4. **Set Research Boundaries**: Define scope to avoid analysis paralysis

**Research Areas to Consider**:
- Technology stack and framework choices
- Third-party integrations and APIs
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security and compliance considerations
- Data storage and management approaches
- User interface and experience patterns

### Step 2: Conduct Research and Build Context

**Research Process**:
1. **Gather Information**: Research technologies, patterns, and best practices
2. **Evaluate Options**: Compare different approaches and their trade-offs
3. **Document Findings**: Summarize key insights that will inform design
4. **Make Preliminary Decisions**: Choose approaches based on research

**Research Documentation Guidelines**:
- Focus on findings that impact design decisions
- Include pros/cons of different approaches
- Cite sources and include relevant links
- Summarize key insights rather than exhaustive details
- Keep research contextual to the specific requirements

### Step 3: Create System Architecture

**Architecture Components**:
1. **System Overview**: High-level description of how the system works
2. **Component Architecture**: Major system components and their relationships
3. **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system
4. **Integration Points**: External systems and APIs
5. **Technology Stack**: Chosen technologies and their rationale

**Architecture Documentation Pattern**:
```markdown
## Architecture

### System Overview
[High-level description of the system approach]

### Component Architecture
[Description of major components and their responsibilities]

### Data Flow
[How data moves through the system]

### Technology Decisions
[Key technology choices and rationale]
```

### Step 4: Define Components and Interfaces

**Component Design Elements**:
1. **Component Responsibilities**: What each component does
2. **Interface Definitions**: How components communicate
3. **Dependency Relationships**: How components depend on each other
4. **Configuration and Setup**: How components are initialized

**Interface Documentation Pattern**:
```markdown
## Components and Interfaces

### [Component Name]
- **Purpose**: [What this component does]
- **Responsibilities**: [Key functions and duties]
- **Interfaces**: [How other components interact with it]
- **Dependencies**: [What this component needs]
```

### Step 5: Design Data Models

**Data Model Elements**:
1. **Entity Definitions**: Core data structures and their properties
2. **Relationships**: How entities relate to each other
3. **Validation Rules**: Data integrity and business rules
4. **Storage Considerations**: How data will be persisted

**Data Model Documentation Pattern**:
```markdown
## Data Models

### [Entity Name]
- **Properties**: [List of fields and their types]
- **Validation**: [Rules for data integrity]
- **Relationships**: [Connections to other entities]
- **Storage**: [Persistence considerations]
```

### Step 6: Plan Error Handling and Edge Cases

**Error Handling Design**:
1. **Error Categories**: Types of errors the system might encounter
2. **Error Response Strategies**: How the system responds to different errors
3. **User Experience**: How errors are communicated to users
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: How the system handles and recovers from errors

### Step 7: Define Testing Strategy

**Testing Strategy Elements**:
1. **Testing Levels**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches
2. **Test Coverage**: What aspects of the system will be tested
3. **Testing Tools**: Frameworks and tools for different types of testing
4. **Quality Gates**: Criteria for determining when testing is sufficient

## Examples of Design Patterns and Decisions

### Example 1: API Design Decision

**Context**: Need to design REST API for user management

**Options Considered**:
1. **RESTful with standard HTTP methods**
   - Pros: Standard, well-understood, good tooling support
   - Cons: May not fit all operations perfectly
2. **GraphQL API**
   - Pros: Flexible queries, single endpoint
   - Cons: Additional complexity, learning curve
3. **RPC-style API**
   - Pros: Direct mapping to business operations
   - Cons: Less standard, harder to cache

**Decision**: RESTful API with standard HTTP methods
**Rationale**: Requirements indicate standard CRUD operations, team familiarity with REST, good ecosystem support

### Example 2: Data Storage Decision

**Context**: Need to store user profiles and preferences

**Options Considered**:
1. **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**
   - Pros: ACID compliance, complex queries, mature ecosystem
   - Cons: Schema rigidity, scaling complexity
2. **Document Database (MongoDB)**
   - Pros: Schema flexibility, easy scaling
   - Cons: Eventual consistency, less mature tooling
3. **Key-Value Store (Redis)**
   - Pros: High performance, simple operations
   - Cons: Limited query capabilities, memory constraints

**Decision**: PostgreSQL with JSON columns for flexible data
**Rationale**: Need for data consistency, complex relationships, with flexibility for user preferences

### Example 3: Authentication Strategy

**Context**: Need secure user authentication

**Options Considered**:
1. **Session-based authentication**
   - Pros: Simple, server-controlled, secure
   - Cons: Scalability challenges, state management
2. **JWT tokens**
   - Pros: Stateless, scalable, cross-domain support
   - Cons: Token revocation complexity, size limitations
3. **OAuth 2.0 with external provider**
   - Pros: No password management, user convenience
   - Cons: External dependency, limited customization

**Decision**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
**Rationale**: Scalability requirements, API-first architecture, security best practices
