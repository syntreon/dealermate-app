# AdminSidebar Bug Fixes Test Plan

## Bug 1: Expand-on-hover overlay collapsing when clicking collapse button
**Issue**: When in expand-on-hover mode with overlay visible, clicking collapse button would immediately hide the overlay.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified `handleModeChange` to preserve hover state when switching to/from expand-on-hover mode
- Only reset hover state when switching away from expand-on-hover mode

**Test Steps**:
1. Set sidebar to "Expand on Hover" mode
2. Hover over sidebar to show overlay
3. While overlay is visible, click the dropdown and select "Collapsed"
4. **Expected**: Overlay should remain visible until mouse leaves the sidebar area
5. Move mouse away from sidebar
6. **Expected**: Overlay should disappear and sidebar should be in collapsed mode

## Bug 2: Layouts not auto-adjusting when sidebar is in expanded mode
**Issue**: When page loads with sidebar in expanded mode, the layout doesn't adjust to account for the wider sidebar.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added initial width dispatch on component mount
- Modified AdminLayout to initialize with correct width based on saved state
- Ensured width calculation is consistent between sidebar and layout

**Test Steps**:
1. Set sidebar to "Expanded" mode
2. Refresh the page
3. **Expected**: Layout should immediately show with correct margins (256px left margin)
4. Content should not be overlapped by the sidebar
5. Switch to "Collapsed" mode
6. **Expected**: Layout should adjust to 64px left margin
7. Switch back to "Expanded" mode
8. **Expected**: Layout should adjust to 256px left margin

## Additional Improvements
- Increased mouse leave delay from 100ms to 150ms for better UX
- Fixed width calculation consistency across all modes
- Ensured proper state persistence and restoration
