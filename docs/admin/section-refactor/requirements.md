# Admin Section Layout Refactor - Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the admin section to a more scalable, enterprise-grade dual-sidebar layout. The goal is to improve navigation, maintainability, and provide a consistent user experience across all admin functionalities.

## 2. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 1: Unified Main Navigation

**User Story:** As an Admin User, I want a primary, persistent sidebar showing the main admin sections, so that I can quickly jump between major functional areas like Dashboard, Analytics, and Settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  **WHEN** I navigate to any page within the `/admin/**` path, **THEN** the system **SHALL** display a primary sidebar on the far left of the screen.
2.  **IF** the primary sidebar is in its expanded state, **THEN** the system **SHALL** display both an icon and a text label for each main navigation item.
3.  **IF** the primary sidebar is in its collapsed state, **THEN** the system **SHALL** display only an icon for each main navigation item.
4.  **WHEN** I click a main navigation item (e.g., "Analytics"), **THEN** the system **SHALL** navigate to the default page for that section (e.g., `/admin/analytics`).

### Requirement 2: Section-Specific Sub-Navigation

**User Story:** As an Admin User, when I am within any admin section (e.g., Analytics, Settings, User Management), I want a secondary sidebar with links relevant only to that section, so I can easily explore all its features without cluttering the main navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  **WHEN** I am on a page within any main section that has sub-pages (e.g., `/admin/analytics/*`, `/admin/settings/*`), **THEN** the system **SHALL** display a secondary sidebar next to the primary sidebar.
2.  **IF** I am in the "Analytics" section, **THEN** the secondary sidebar **SHALL** display links for its sub-pages (e.g., "Financials", "Clients", "Users").
3.  **IF** I am in the "Settings" section, **THEN** the secondary sidebar **SHALL** display links for its sub-pages (e.g., "General", "Agent Config", "Notifications").
4.  **IF** I am in the "User Management" section, **THEN** the secondary sidebar **SHALL** display links for its sub-pages (e.g., "All Users", "Roles & Permissions").
5.  **WHEN** I click a link in any secondary sidebar (e.g., "Financials"), **THEN** the system **SHALL** navigate to that specific page (`/admin/analytics/financials`) and render its content in the main content area.
6.  **IF** a main section has no sub-pages (e.g., "Dashboard", "Audit Logs"), **THEN** the system **SHALL NOT** display a secondary sidebar.

### Requirement 3: Content and Layout Management

**User Story:** As an Admin User, I want the main content of the page to adjust correctly based on the presence and state of the sidebars, so that the layout is always clean, responsive, and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  **WHEN** both primary and secondary sidebars are visible, **THEN** the main content area **SHALL** occupy the remaining screen width to the right of the secondary sidebar.
2.  **WHEN** only the primary sidebar is visible, **THEN** the main content area **SHALL** occupy the remaining screen width to the right of the primary sidebar.
3.  **IF** the application is viewed on a mobile device, **THEN** both sidebars **SHALL** be collapsed by default and accessible via a menu button (hamburger icon).

### Requirement 4: Routing and URL Structure

**User Story:** As a Developer, I need a clear and nested routing structure that reflects the new layout, so that code is easy to manage, and pages can be lazy-loaded efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  **WHEN** a URL matches a section's base path (e.g., `/admin/settings/*`), **THEN** the system **SHALL** render the corresponding section layout (e.g., `SettingsLayout`).
2.  **IF** a user navigates to a base path (e.g., `/admin/analytics`), **THEN** the system **SHALL** redirect to the first available sub-page in that section (e.g., `/admin/analytics/financials`).
3.  **WHEN** a new page is created, **THEN** it **SHALL** be lazy-loaded to improve initial application load time.
