- `truncate` - Text overflow handling

### Mobile-First Approach

All improvements follow a mobile-first approach:
1. Design for mobile screens first
2. Add responsive enhancements for larger screens
3. Progressive enhancement rather than graceful degradation
4. Touch-friendly interactions and proper target sizes

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the mobile responsiveness improvements:

1. **Browser DevTools Testing:**
   - Test at 320px, 375px, 414px (common mobile widths)
   - Test at 768px, 1024px (tablet widths)
   - Verify horizontal scrolling is eliminated
   - Check touch target sizes (minimum 44px)

2. **Real Device Testing:**
   - Test on actual mobile devices when possible
   - Verify touch interactions work properly
   - Check readability and usability

3. **Orientation Testing:**
   - Test both portrait and landscape orientations
   - Ensure layouts adapt properly to orientation changes

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Advanced Mobile Patterns:**
   - Bottom sheet modals for mobile
   - Swipe gestures for table actions
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality

2. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Virtual scrolling for large tables
   - Lazy loading of table content
   - Image optimization for mobile
