# Call Evaluation Scoring Correction

## Issue Identified
The initial implementation incorrectly assumed all scores were out of 10, but the actual database schema uses scores out of 5.

## Corrections Made

### 1. Service Layer (`src/services/leadEvaluationService.ts`)
- **Updated maxScore**: Changed from 10 to 5 for all score cards
- **Updated color calculation**: Now uses 5 as the maximum for percentage calculations
- **Updated failure risk inversion**: Changed from `10 - score` to `5 - score`

### 2. UI Display (`src/components/calls/CallDetailsPopup.tsx`)
- **Overall Score Display**: Changed from `X/10` to `X/5`
- **Progress bars**: Now correctly show percentage based on 5-point scale

### 3. Test Files
- **Mock Data**: Updated all test scores to realistic 0-5 values
- **Expected Results**: Updated test assertions to match 5-point scale
- **Color Expectations**: Adjusted color expectations based on new percentages

### 4. Documentation
- **Implementation Guide**: Updated to reflect 5-point scoring system
- **Database Schema**: Clarified that individual scores are 0-5 integers
- **Overall Score**: Noted that overall_evaluation_score is numeric(4,2) allowing decimals

## Scoring Scale Details

### Individual Scores (0-5 integers):
- `lead_completion_score`
- `clarity_politeness_score`
- `relevance_questions_score`
- `objection_handling_score`
- `naturalness_score`
- `lead_intent_score`
- `failure_risk_score`

### Overall Score (0-5 with decimals):
- `overall_evaluation_score` - numeric(4,2) field
- Displayed as X.X/5 (e.g., "4.2/5")

### Color Coding (based on percentage):
- **Green**: 80%+ (4.0+ out of 5)
- **Yellow**: 60-79% (3.0-3.9 out of 5)
- **Red**: <60% (<3.0 out of 5)

## Verification
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Test script runs correctly
- ✅ UI displays proper scale
- ✅ Color coding works as expected
- ✅ Documentation updated

## Impact
This correction ensures that:
1. Score displays are accurate and meaningful
2. Color coding reflects appropriate thresholds for 5-point scale
3. Progress bars show correct percentages
4. User expectations align with actual data ranges
5. Consistency with existing Quality Analytics implementation
