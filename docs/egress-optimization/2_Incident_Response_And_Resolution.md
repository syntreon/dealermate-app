# 2. Incident Response & Resolution

## Summary
This section documents the immediate actions taken to contain the egress crisis, activate emergency controls, and restore system stability. It includes a timeline of interventions, emergency mode activation, and communication steps.

---

## Response Timeline
- **Detection:** Monitoring flagged abnormal egress rates
- **Emergency Mode Activated:** All auto-refresh and realtime updates disabled
- **Manual Emergency Actions:** Admin dashboard fallback, cache TTL increased, mock data enabled
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Incident declared, status updates provided

---

## Actionable Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions Required
- **Set environment variable**: In `.env`, set `VITE_EGRESS_MODE=emergency` to enable emergency mode.
- **Restart server**: Restart your server to apply the new environment setting.
- **Activate emergency mode**: In the browser console, run:
  ```js
  window.egressEmergency.activate();
  ```
- **Verify**: Confirm all auto-refresh and periodic API calls are stopped. Check the network tab for reduced API activity.
- **Fallback**: If issues persist, clear localStorage for `egress_emergency_mode` and reload.

### 2. Emergency Activation Manual
- **Manual activation**: Use the browser console command above to trigger emergency mode at any time.
- **Persistence**: Emergency mode will persist for 24 hours or until deactivated.
- **Deactivation**: To restore normal operation, run:
  ```js
  window.egressEmergency.deactivate();
  ```

### 3. Emergency Dashboard Fix
- **Fallback dashboard**: If the admin dashboard fails to load due to excessive API calls or errors, emergency mode will automatically disable all real-time widgets and periodic updates.
- **Manual refresh**: Users can still manually refresh dashboard data as needed.
- **UI feedback**: An alert will be shown to indicate emergency mode is active.

### 4. Final Action Checklist
- [ ] Emergency mode activated and verified
- [ ] All auto-refresh and real-time updates disabled
- [ ] Network tab shows minimal API calls
- [ ] Manual refresh works for all analytics and dashboard sections
- [ ] No loading errors or excessive API activity
- [ ] Emergency mode can be deactivated and normal operation restored
