## 📚 Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Memoized Components
- Components with 100-1000 items
- Frequent prop updates from parent components
- Complex rendering logic
- Components that don't need to update when parent re-renders

### When to Use Virtualized Components
- Datasets with 1000+ items
- Scroll performance is critical
- Memory constraints are a concern
- Mobile device compatibility is important

### Performance Best Practices
1. Use stable keys for list items
2. Memoize callback props with useCallback
3. Avoid creating objects in render functions
4. Use shallow comparison when possible
5. Monitor performance with built-in utilities
