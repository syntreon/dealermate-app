# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an enterprise-grade admin section layout pattern with a sophisticated 3-state main sidebar (collapsed, expanded, expand on hover) and modular section-specific layouts. Each admin section (Management, Analytics, Logs, Settings) will have its own dedicated layout with section-specific navigation, while the Dashboard remains a single page without sub-navigation.

The system will feature a main sidebar that can be toggled between three states via a footer control, with each section containing its own sub-sidebar that remains always expanded within its parent layout. The layout system will be fully responsive and adapt to the main sidebar's current state.
