# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current theme system in the Dealermate application has several critical issues that need to be addressed. The app is not properly detecting system theme preferences, components are inconsistently styled with mixed light/dark mode elements, and the theme selectors in the top bar and settings page are not synchronized. This creates a poor user experience with visual inconsistencies throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically detect and respect my system's theme preference (light/dark mode), so that the app matches my operating system's appearance settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL detect the user's system theme preference (light/dark)
2. WHEN the system theme preference is detected THEN the application SHALL apply the corresponding theme automatically
3. WHEN the user has no previously saved theme preference THEN the system SHALL default to the detected system theme
4. WHEN the system theme changes while the app is running THEN the application SHALL update its theme accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all components throughout the application to consistently follow the selected theme, so that there are no mixed light/dark mode elements visible at the same time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a theme is applied THEN all UI components SHALL use consistent theme-aware styling
2. WHEN viewing charts and analytics THEN all chart elements including hover cards and tooltips SHALL follow the current theme
3. WHEN interacting with any component THEN hover states, focus states, and active states SHALL respect the current theme
4. WHEN new components are created THEN they SHALL automatically inherit proper theme styling without manual intervention

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme selector in the top bar and the theme preference in settings to be synchronized, so that changing the theme in one location updates it everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change the theme using the top bar selector THEN the settings page SHALL reflect the same theme preference
2. WHEN I change the theme preference in settings THEN the top bar selector SHALL update to match
3. WHEN I change the theme in any location THEN the change SHALL be persisted across browser sessions
4. WHEN the theme is changed THEN all parts of the application SHALL update immediately without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want chart components and their interactive elements (hover cards, tooltips, data points) to properly follow the theme, so that the data visualization experience is consistent with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing charts in dark mode THEN all chart elements including backgrounds, text, and borders SHALL use dark theme colors
2. WHEN hovering over chart data points THEN the hover cards and tooltips SHALL use theme-appropriate colors and styling
3. WHEN viewing charts in light mode THEN all chart elements SHALL use light theme colors consistently
4. WHEN switching themes THEN chart components SHALL update their styling immediately without requiring interaction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized theme configuration system that ensures all components automatically use correct theme values, so that future development maintains theme consistency without additional effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new components THEN they SHALL automatically inherit correct theme styling through the centralized system
2. WHEN theme values need to be updated THEN changes SHALL be made in a single location and propagate throughout the application
3. WHEN debugging theme issues THEN there SHALL be clear documentation and structure for the theme system
4. WHEN building the application THEN the theme system SHALL not introduce performance overhead or bundle size issues
