# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The theme system in the Dealermate application needs to be optimized for instant responsiveness while maintaining proper theme persistence. The primary focus is on providing immediate visual feedback when users change themes, with database synchronization happening seamlessly in the background. The system must be lightweight, performant, and not interfere with overall application responsiveness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want theme changes to be instant and responsive, so that the application feels fast and doesn't lag when I switch themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the theme toggle THEN the theme SHALL change instantly with no perceptible delay
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN all UI elements SHALL update immediately without waiting for database operations
3. WHEN I interact with buttons or hover elements after a theme change THEN there SHALL be no lag or delay
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the theme SHALL be applied instantly from local storage or system preference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want theme preferences to be saved automatically in the background, so that my choice persists without affecting application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change the theme THEN the preference SHALL be saved to local storage immediately
2. WHEN the theme preference is saved THEN database synchronization SHALL happen in the background without blocking the UI
3. WHEN I reload the application THEN my theme preference SHALL be restored instantly from local storage
4. WHEN database sync fails THEN the UI SHALL continue to work normally with local storage as fallback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all components throughout the application to consistently follow the selected theme, so that there are no mixed light/dark mode elements visible at the same time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a theme is applied THEN all UI components SHALL use consistent theme-aware styling instantly
2. WHEN viewing charts and analytics THEN all chart elements including hover cards and tooltips SHALL follow the current theme
3. WHEN interacting with any component THEN hover states, focus states, and active states SHALL respond immediately
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the theme SHALL remain consistent without re-initialization delays

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme selector in the top bar and the theme preference in settings to be synchronized instantly, so that changing the theme in one location updates it everywhere immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change the theme using the top bar selector THEN the settings page SHALL reflect the same theme preference instantly
2. WHEN I change the theme preference in settings THEN the top bar selector SHALL update to match immediately
3. WHEN I change the theme in any location THEN all parts of the application SHALL update instantly
4. WHEN I navigate between admin panel and main app THEN the theme SHALL remain consistent without automatic changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a lightweight theme system that doesn't impact application performance, so that the app remains fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing theme changes THEN the system SHALL not introduce UI lag or delays
2. WHEN users interact with the application THEN theme operations SHALL not block user interactions
3. WHEN building new components THEN they SHALL automatically inherit theme styling without performance overhead
4. WHEN the application starts THEN theme initialization SHALL not delay the initial render
