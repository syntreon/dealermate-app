# Authentication Performance Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This spec addresses the remaining authentication performance issues and duplicate API calls that are causing poor user experience during login and dashboard loading.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Eliminate Database Query Timeouts

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login to complete quickly without database timeouts, so that I can access the application immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the database query for user profile SHALL complete within 3 seconds
2. WHEN the database query times out THEN the system SHALL retry once before falling back
3. WHEN using fallback user data THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh with real data in the background
4. WHEN the user profile loads successfully THEN no timeout errors SHALL appear in console logs

### Requirement 2: Prevent Duplicate Dashboard Metrics Calls

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load efficiently without making redundant API calls, so that the interface is responsive and doesn't waste resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN metrics SHALL be fetched only once per user session
2. WHEN the user object updates during authentication THEN metrics SHALL NOT be refetched if user permissions haven't changed
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN only the final user state SHALL trigger metrics loading
4. WHEN viewing console logs THEN duplicate "Fetched metrics" messages SHALL NOT appear

### Requirement 3: Optimize Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth authentication transitions without multiple loading states, so that the login experience feels seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state changes THEN dependent hooks SHALL update only when necessary
2. WHEN user object reference changes THEN hooks SHALL compare actual values before re-executing
3. WHEN session processing completes THEN all dependent components SHALL receive the final state simultaneously
4. WHEN authentication is complete THEN no unnecessary re-renders SHALL occur

### Requirement 4: Improve Database Connection Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable database connections during authentication, so that I don't experience random login failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying the database THEN connection SHALL be established with proper timeout handling
2. WHEN a query fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error for debugging
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to the user
4. WHEN retrying failed queries THEN exponential backoff SHALL be used to avoid overwhelming the database

### Requirement 5: Implement Proper Hook Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React hooks to have proper dependency arrays, so that components don't re-render unnecessarily and performance is optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user authentication state changes THEN only hooks that depend on changed values SHALL re-execute
2. WHEN user object is recreated with same values THEN dependent hooks SHALL NOT re-run
3. WHEN implementing useEffect hooks THEN dependency arrays SHALL include only primitive values or stable references
4. WHEN debugging hook behavior THEN console logs SHALL clearly indicate why hooks are re-executing
