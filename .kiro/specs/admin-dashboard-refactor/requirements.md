# Admin Dashboard Refactor - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature refactors the existing admin interface from a tab-based AdminDashboard and overlapping AdminAnalytics into a hierarchical, sidebar-navigated interface similar to Supabase's admin panel. The new structure will eliminate redundant features, reduce complexity, and create a scalable pattern for future admin features while reusing existing components and services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hierarchical Sidebar Navigation

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want a hierarchical sidebar navigation system similar to Supabase, so that I can easily navigate between different admin sections without tab overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin interface loads THEN it SHALL display a collapsible sidebar with hierarchical navigation
2. WHEN I click on a main section THEN it SHALL expand to show sub-sections if available
3. WHEN I navigate to a page THEN the sidebar SHALL highlight the active section and sub-section
4. WHEN I collapse the sidebar THEN it SHALL show only icons with tooltips
5. WHEN on mobile THEN the sidebar SHALL overlay or transform into a mobile-friendly navigation

### Requirement 2: Page-Based Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each admin section to be a separate page component, so that the codebase is more modular and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new admin section THEN it SHALL be a separate page component in its own file
2. WHEN pages are loaded THEN they SHALL reuse existing components, services, and hooks where possible
3. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be no larger than 200 lines of code each
4. WHEN pages are accessed THEN they SHALL maintain consistent layout using AdminLayout
5. WHEN routing is configured THEN it SHALL follow the hierarchical structure defined in the sidebar

### Requirement 3: Component Reuse and Service Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reuse existing components and services, so that I don't duplicate code and maintain consistency across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new pages THEN they SHALL reuse existing AdminService, MetricsCalculationService, and other established services
2. WHEN displaying data THEN they SHALL reuse existing components like FinancialOverview, BusinessMetrics, and chart components
3. WHEN implementing features THEN they SHALL extend existing hooks like useAdminDashboardData
4. WHEN styling components THEN they SHALL use the established theme system with semantic color tokens
5. WHEN handling errors THEN they SHALL use existing error handling patterns and components

### Requirement 4: Elimination of Redundant Features

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want a streamlined interface without duplicate features, so that I can efficiently access the information I need without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN there SHALL be no overlapping features between different admin sections
2. WHEN I access analytics THEN all analytics features SHALL be consolidated into appropriate hierarchical sections
3. WHEN I view financial data THEN it SHALL be presented in a single, comprehensive location
4. WHEN I manage users or clients THEN the functionality SHALL not be duplicated across multiple pages
5. WHEN I navigate the interface THEN each feature SHALL have a clear, single location

### Requirement 5: Scalable Navigation Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized navigation configuration, so that adding new admin sections is straightforward and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new admin section THEN I SHALL only need to update a central navigation configuration file
2. WHEN navigation items are rendered THEN they SHALL be generated from the configuration automatically
3. WHEN permissions change THEN the navigation SHALL filter items based on user roles dynamically
4. WHEN the sidebar is rendered THEN it SHALL support nested navigation items with proper hierarchy
5. WHEN icons or labels change THEN they SHALL be updated in a single configuration location

### Requirement 6: Mobile Responsiveness

**User Story:** As an admin using a mobile device, I want the dashboard to be fully functional and easy to navigate, so that I can monitor business metrics on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is viewed on mobile THEN it SHALL use horizontal scrolling tabs like the Analytics page
2. WHEN metric cards are displayed THEN they SHALL stack appropriately on smaller screens
3. WHEN charts and graphs are shown THEN they SHALL be readable and interactive on touch devices
4. WHEN tables are displayed THEN they SHALL be horizontally scrollable with sticky headers
5. WHEN the refresh button is used THEN it SHALL be easily accessible on mobile devices

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the dashboard to handle errors gracefully and continue showing available data, so that temporary issues don't prevent me from accessing critical metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component fails to load data THEN it SHALL show an error state without breaking other components
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN they SHALL be retried automatically with exponential backoff
3. WHEN partial data is available THEN it SHALL be displayed with appropriate indicators for missing information
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the dashboard SHALL show cached data if available
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 8: Real-time Updates

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the dashboard to show current data and update automatically, so that I always have the latest business metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is open THEN it SHALL refresh data automatically every 5 minutes
2. WHEN manual refresh is triggered THEN it SHALL update all visible components
3. WHEN new data is available THEN it SHALL be reflected in the UI without requiring a page reload
4. WHEN real-time events occur THEN they SHALL be reflected in relevant dashboard components
5. WHEN the user is inactive THEN automatic updates SHALL be paused to conserve resources
