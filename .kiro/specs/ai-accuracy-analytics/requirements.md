# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Accuracy Analytics feature will replace the existing Cost Analytics tab in the Analytics page to provide comprehensive insights into AI model performance, conversation quality, and accuracy tracking. This feature will help dealership managers and Dealermate administrators understand which AI models perform better, identify common failure patterns, and monitor overall system accuracy through detailed analysis of call evaluations and prompt adherence data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dealership manager, I want to view AI model performance metrics, so that I can understand which models are providing the best customer service quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the AI Accuracy Analytics tab THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive dashboard showing AI model performance metrics
2. WHEN viewing model performance THEN the system SHALL show accuracy scores, conversation quality metrics, and model usage statistics
3. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side performance comparisons with statistical significance indicators
4. IF multiple models are used THEN the system SHALL display performance trends over time for each model

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to identify specific areas where AI accuracy fails, so that I can improve model training and prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing accuracy failures THEN the system SHALL extract and categorize keywords from prompt adherence reviews
2. WHEN displaying failure categories THEN the system SHALL show common failure types like hallucination, transcriber errors, rule violations, etc.
3. WHEN viewing failure analysis THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdowns of what went wrong and recommendations for improvement
4. IF critical failures are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight them with appropriate visual indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want to monitor conversation quality metrics across different AI models, so that I can ensure consistent service standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing conversation quality THEN the system SHALL display metrics from lead evaluations including clarity, politeness, relevance, and naturalness scores
2. WHEN analyzing quality trends THEN the system SHALL show performance over time with filtering capabilities by date range and client
3. WHEN comparing quality metrics THEN the system SHALL correlate conversation quality with specific AI models used
4. IF quality scores drop below thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to filter and segment AI accuracy data, so that I can perform detailed analysis for specific time periods, clients, or model configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options for date range, client, model type, and accuracy thresholds
2. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL update all visualizations and metrics in real-time
3. WHEN viewing segmented data THEN the system SHALL maintain context and provide drill-down capabilities
4. IF no data exists for selected filters THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to see actionable insights from AI accuracy data, so that I can make informed decisions about model selection and system improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide summary cards with key performance indicators and trends
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL generate automated insights and recommendations based on data patterns
3. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable recommendations for improvement
4. IF performance changes significantly THEN the system SHALL highlight these changes with contextual explanations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a technical user, I want to access detailed technical metrics about AI model performance, so that I can optimize system configuration and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing technical metrics THEN the system SHALL display model-specific performance data including response times, token usage, and cost efficiency
2. WHEN analyzing model behavior THEN the system SHALL show correlation between model parameters and accuracy outcomes
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and failure analysis with technical context
4. IF system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and suggested remediation steps
