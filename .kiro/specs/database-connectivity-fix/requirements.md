# Database Connectivity Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The authentication system is experiencing database query timeouts when loading user profiles from the `public.users` table. This causes the system to fall back to temporary user profiles with incorrect permissions, leading to degraded user experience and potential security issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Database Connection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to reliably connect to the database so that my profile loads correctly every time I log in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL successfully load their profile from the database within 3 seconds
2. WHEN the database query succeeds THEN the system SHALL use the actual user data with correct role and permissions
3. WHEN the initial query fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 2 times with exponential backoff
4. IF all retries fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging to the user

### Requirement 2: Improved Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when there are connectivity issues so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN using fallback user data THEN the system SHALL display a warning message to the user
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically retry loading the correct user profile
4. WHEN errors persist THEN the system SHALL provide options to refresh or contact support

### Requirement 3: Connection Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized database connections so that queries execute quickly and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making database queries THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and optimization
2. WHEN querying user data THEN the system SHALL only select necessary fields to reduce payload size
3. WHEN detecting slow queries THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate indexing strategies
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns

### Requirement 4: Fallback Strategy

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain functional even when there are temporary database issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL use cached user data if available
2. WHEN no cached data exists THEN the system SHALL create a safe fallback user profile
3. WHEN using fallback data THEN the system SHALL restrict access to sensitive operations
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition to real user data

### Requirement 5: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want visibility into database performance so that I can proactively address issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL track response times and success rates
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log warnings and metrics
3. WHEN timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL capture diagnostic information
4. WHEN patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights for optimization
