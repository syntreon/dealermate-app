# Database Connectivity Fix Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Immediate Fixes

- [ ] 1. Optimize Supabase client configuration
  - Configure connection pooling and timeout settings
  - Add proper error handling for network issues
  - Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Enhance user profile loading with retry mechanism
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (3s, 5s, 8s timeouts)
  - Add detailed error logging for debugging
  - Create robust fallback user profile generation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Implement connection health monitoring
  - Add connection status checking before queries
  - Track query performance metrics (response time, success rate)
  - Implement circuit breaker pattern for sustained failures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.1, 5.2_

## Phase 2: User Experience Improvements

- [ ] 4. Add user-facing error handling and notifications
  - Display warning messages when using fallback profiles
  - Show loading states during retry attempts
  - Provide refresh options for users experiencing issues
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement user profile caching
  - Cache successful user profile loads in localStorage
  - Use cached data when database queries fail
  - Implement cache invalidation and refresh strategies
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Create fallback user permission restrictions
  - Limit fallback users to read-only operations
  - Block access to admin functions and sensitive data
  - Add visual indicators for degraded functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.3_

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization

- [ ] 7. Optimize database queries
  - Select only necessary fields in user profile queries
  - Add database indexes for user lookup performance
  - Implement query result caching at the database level
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Add comprehensive performance monitoring
  - Track and log all database query metrics
  - Implement alerting for performance degradation
  - Create dashboard for monitoring connection health
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement advanced error recovery
  - Add automatic retry when connectivity is restored
  - Implement seamless transition from fallback to real user data
  - Add background profile refresh for cached users
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.4_

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Unit tests for retry logic and error handling
  - Integration tests for database connectivity scenarios
  - Performance tests under various network conditions
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 11. Implement monitoring and alerting
  - Set up alerts for high timeout rates and connection failures
  - Create metrics dashboard for system health monitoring
  - Add user experience tracking for authentication flow
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 12. Documentation and deployment
  - Document new error handling and fallback behaviors
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common connectivity issues
  - Deploy with gradual rollout and monitoring
  - _Requirements: All requirements completion_
