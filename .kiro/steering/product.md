# Product Overview: Dealermate

## 1. Mission & Vision

**Mission:** To ensure that modern auto dealerships never lose a lead by providing an intelligent AI Call Facilitation service that answers every call with the professionalism of their most experienced sales manager.

## 2. Core Product: AI Call Facilitation

Dealermate is not just a software platform; it's a service that extends a dealership's sales team. The core of the product is a sophisticated AI that handles all inbound calls 24/7.

The accompanying SaaS dashboard provides complete transparency and control over the AI's performance, offering deep analytics and management tools.
